<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I am a data scientist and software engineer at RStudio where I work on [open source modeling tools](https://www.tidymodels.org/). My last name is pronounced SILL-GHEE (two syllables, short `i`, hard `g`). I love making beautiful charts, the statistical programming language R, Jane Austen, black coffee, and red wine.
