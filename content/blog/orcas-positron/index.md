This is my first [screencast](https://www.youtube.com/juliasilge) in quite a while! I've been busy working on [Positron](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron) a new, next-generation data science IDE, and I'm excited to share a little first look at it with you today. Positron is currently in public beta and there is still a lot of work to get it ready for everyone to use, but in this screencast, I give you a first look at what data analysis with Positron will look like, using this week's [`#TidyTuesday` dataset](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) on orca encounters in the Salish Sea.

Huge thanks to Jadey Ryan for her [work on this package](https://github.com/jadeynryan/orcas)!

We know Positron still has some rough edges, but if you are interested in experimenting with it, I invite you to [download the most recent beta release](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/releases) and [share your feedback with us](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/discussions).
