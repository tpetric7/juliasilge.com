summary: "The spatialsample package is gaining many new methods this summer, and we can use spatially aware resampling to understand how drought is related to other quantities across Texas."
---

This is the latest in my series of [screencasts](https://juliasilge.com/category/tidymodels/) demonstrating how to use the [tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org/) packages.
This summer, I am so happy to be working with [Mike Mahoney](https://www.mm218.dev/) as one of our open source interns at RStudio; Mike is spending the summer with us working on the [spatialsample](https://spatialsample.tidymodels.org/dev/) package.
This screencast walks through how to use spatial resampling with this week‚Äôs [`#TidyTuesday` dataset](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) on drought.

Here is the code I used in the video, for those who prefer reading instead of or in addition to video.

## Explore data

Our modeling goal is to use resampling to understand how [drought](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2022/2022-06-14) is related to another characteristic in a location, like perhaps income. I am definitely not making a causal claim here! However, we can use resampling and simple models to understand how quantities are related.

Since I am from Texas (and it has a nice number of counties), let‚Äôs restrict our analysis to only counties in Texas:

``` r
library(tidyverse)

drought_raw <- read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/2022-06-14/drought-fips.csv')

drought <- drought_raw %>%
  filter(State == "TX", lubridate::year(date) == 2021) %>%
  group_by(GEOID = FIPS) %>%
  summarise(DSCI = mean(DSCI)) %>%
  ungroup()

drought
```

    ## # A tibble: 254 √ó 2
    ##    GEOID  DSCI
    ##    <chr> <dbl>
    ##  1 48001  68.7
    ##  2 48003 244.
    ##  3 48005  81
    ##  4 48007  46.8
    ##  5 48009  62.1
    ##  6 48011 138.
    ##  7 48013  84.9
    ##  8 48015  40.1
    ##  9 48017 253.
    ## 10 48019 114.
    ## # ‚Ä¶ with 244 more rows

## Visualizing drought in TX

Whenever I see FIPS codes, I think [tidycensus](https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/)! I am such a huge fan of that package and how it has made accessing and using US Census data easier in R. Let‚Äôs get the median household income for counties in Texas from the ACS tables. (I had to look up the right name for this table.)

``` r
library(tidycensus)

tx_median_rent <-
  get_acs(
    geography = "county",
    state = "TX",
    variables = "B19013_001",
    year = 2020,
    geometry = TRUE,

  )

tx_median_rent
```

Notice that this a [simple features](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) dataframe, with a geometry that we can plot. Let‚Äôs join the drought data together with the Census data:

``` r
drought_sf <- tx_median_rent %>% left_join(drought)
```

We can use ggplot2 to map datasets like this without too much trouble:

``` r
drought_sf %>%
  ggplot(aes(fill = DSCI)) +
  geom_sf(alpha = 0.9, color = NA) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c()
```

<img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="1440" />

Looks like last year, the highest rates of drought in Texas were far west in the Panhandle and towards El Paso.

How are drought and our Census variable, median household income, related?

``` r
drought_sf %>%
  ggplot(aes(DSCI, estimate)) +
  geom_point(size = 2, alpha = 0.8) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar_format()) +
  labs(x = "Drought score", y = "Median household income")
```

<img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="1440" />

It looks like areas with high drought have lower incomes, but this might be pretty much flat without those several high income, low drought counties up in the top left.

## Build a model

In tidymodels, one of the first steps we recommend thinking about is ‚Äúspending your data budget.‚Äù When it comes to spatial data like what we have from the Census, areas close to each other are often similar so we don‚Äôt want to randomly resample our observations. Instead, we want to use a resampling strategy that accounts for that autocorrelation. This summer Mike has been [adding great new resampling methods](https://spatialsample.tidymodels.org/dev/reference/index.html); let‚Äôs use spatial block cross-validation for these counties in Texas.

``` r
library(tidymodels)
library(spatialsample)

set.seed(123)
folds <- spatial_block_cv(drought_sf, v = 10)
folds
```

    ## #  10-fold spatial block cross-validation
    ## # A tibble: 10 √ó 2
    ##    splits           id
    ##    <list>           <chr>
    ##  1 <split [223/31]> Fold01
    ##  2 <split [219/35]> Fold02
    ##  3 <split [234/20]> Fold03
    ##  4 <split [226/28]> Fold04
    ##  5 <split [228/26]> Fold05
    ##  6 <split [226/28]> Fold06
    ##  7 <split [236/18]> Fold07
    ##  8 <split [231/23]> Fold08
    ##  9 <split [237/17]> Fold09
    ## 10 <split [226/28]> Fold10

The spatialsample package has also gained an `autoplot()` method for its resampling objects:

``` r
autoplot(folds)
```

<img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="1440" />

You can also `autoplot()` any individual split to see what is in the analysis (or training) set and what is in the assessment (or testing) set:

``` r
autoplot(folds$splits[[1]])
```

<img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="1440" />

Now that we have spent our data budget in an appropriate way for this spatial data, we can build a model. Let‚Äôs create a simple linear model explaining the median income by the drought score, and fit that model to each of our resamples. We can use `control_resamples(save_pred = TRUE)` to save not only the metrics but also the predictions for each resample.

``` r
drought_res <-
    workflow(estimate ~ DSCI, linear_reg()) %>%
    fit_resamples(folds, control = control_resamples(save_pred = TRUE))

drought_res
```

    ## # Resampling results
    ## # 10-fold spatial block cross-validation
    ## # A tibble: 10 √ó 5
    ##    splits           id     .metrics         .notes           .predictions
    ##    <list>           <chr>  <list>           <list>           <list>
    ##  1 <split [223/31]> Fold01 <tibble [2 √ó 4]> <tibble [0 √ó 3]> <tibble [31 √ó 4]>
    ##  2 <split [219/35]> Fold02 <tibble [2 √ó 4]> <tibble [0 √ó 3]> <tibble [35 √ó 4]>
    ##  3 <split [234/20]> Fold03 <tibble [2 √ó 4]> <tibble [0 √ó 3]> <tibble [20 √ó 4]>
    ##  4 <split [226/28]> Fold04 <tibble [2 √ó 4]> <tibble [0 √ó 3]> <tibble [28 √ó 4]>
    ##  5 <split [228/26]> Fold05 <tibble [2 √ó 4]> <tibble [0 √ó 3]> <tibble [26 √ó 4]>
    ##  6 <split [226/28]> Fold06 <tibble [2 √ó 4]> <tibble [0 √ó 3]> <tibble [28 √ó 4]>
    ##  7 <split [236/18]> Fold07 <tibble [2 √ó 4]> <tibble [0 √ó 3]> <tibble [18 √ó 4]>
    ##  8 <split [231/23]> Fold08 <tibble [2 √ó 4]> <tibble [0 √ó 3]> <tibble [23 √ó 4]>
    ##  9 <split [237/17]> Fold09 <tibble [2 √ó 4]> <tibble [0 √ó 3]> <tibble [17 √ó 4]>
    ## 10 <split [226/28]> Fold10 <tibble [2 √ó 4]> <tibble [0 √ó 3]> <tibble [28 √ó 4]>

What do the predictions for household income look like?

``` r
collect_predictions(drought_res)
```

    ## # A tibble: 254 √ó 5
    ##    id      .pred  .row estimate .config
    ##    <chr>   <dbl> <int>    <dbl> <chr>

    ## 10 Fold01 51866.    37    61915 Preprocessor1_Model1
    ## # ‚Ä¶ with 244 more rows

## Mapping modeling results

We can join these out-of-sample predictions back up with our original data, and compute any [metrics](https://yardstick.tidymodels.org/) we would like to, like RMSE, for all the counties in Texas.

``` r
drought_rmse <-
    drought_sf %>%
    mutate(.row = row_number()) %>%
    left_join(collect_predictions(drought_res)) %>%
    group_by(GEOID) %>%
    rmse(estimate, .pred) %>%
    select(GEOID, .estimate)
drought_rmse
```

    ## # A tibble: 254 √ó 2
    ##    GEOID .estimate
    ##    <chr>     <dbl>
    ##  1 48001    10604.
    ##  2 48003    28840.
    ##  3 48005     6550.
    ##  4 48007     7858.
    ##  5 48009     8149.
    ##  6 48011    17246.
    ##  7 48013     3856.
    ##  8 48015     7263.
    ##  9 48017     7160.
    ## 10 48019     6730.
    ## # ‚Ä¶ with 244 more rows

Let‚Äôs join this one more time to our original data, and plot the RMSE in dollars across Texas.

``` r
drought_sf %>%
    left_join(drought_rmse) %>%
    ggplot(aes(fill = .estimate)) +
    geom_sf(color = NA, alpha = 0.8) +
    labs(fill = "RMSE") +
    scale_fill_viridis_c(labels = scales::dollar_format())
```

<img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png" width="1440" />

This is so interesting! Those high RMSE counties are urban counties like those containing Dallas and Forth Worth, Houston, Austin, etc. In an urban county, the median household income is high relative to the drought being experienced. Again, this is not a causal claim, but instead a way to use these tools to understand the relationship.

If you're interested in trying out the new spatialsample features like this one, please [install from GitHub](https://github.com/tidymodels/spatialsample/). Now is a great time for feedback because we'll be doing a CRAN release soon!
