This is the latest in my series of [screencasts](https://juliasilge.com/category/tidymodels/) demonstrating how to use the [tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org/) packages, from just getting started to tuning more complex models. Today's screencast walks through how to handle workflow objects, with this week's [`#TidyTuesday` dataset](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) on Doctor Who episodes. `r emo::ji("blue_heart")`

Here is the code I used in the video, for those who prefer reading instead of or in addition to video.

## Explore data

Our modeling goal is to predict the UK viewership of [Doctor Who episodes](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2021/2021-11-23/readme.md) (since the 2005 revival) from the episodes' air date. How has the viewership of these episodes changed over time?

```{r}
episodes <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-11-23/episodes.csv') %>%
    filter(!is.na(uk_viewers))

episodes %>%
    ggplot(aes(first_aired, uk_viewers)) +
    geom_line(alpha = 0.8, size = 1.2, color = "midnightblue") +
    labs(x = NULL)
```

These are quite spiky, with much higher viewer numbers for special episodes like season finales or Christmas episodes.

I have only ever watched episodes of Doctor Who after they arrive on US streaming platforms, but I will say that I haven't caught up on some of the latest seasons, much like many viewers in the UK.

## Create a workflow

In tidymodels, we typically recommend using a [workflow](https://www.tmwr.org/workflows.html) in your modeling analyses, to make it easier to carry around preprocessing and modeling components in your code and to protect against errors. Let's create some bootstrap resampling folds for these episodes, and then a workflow to predict viewership (in millions) from the air date.

```{r}
library(tidymodels)

set.seed(123)
folds <- bootstraps(episodes, times = 100, strata = uk_viewers)
folds
```

We want to use `first_aired` as our predictor, but let's do some feature engineering here. Let's create a date feature (just year here; if we had more data, maybe we could try week of the year or month), and also create a feature for a few holidays that are celebrated in the UK and have special Doctor Who episodes.

```{r}
who_rec <-
    recipe(uk_viewers ~ first_aired, data = episodes) %>%
    step_date(first_aired, features = "year") %>%
    step_holiday(first_aired, 
                 holidays = c("NewYearsDay", "ChristmasDay"),
                 keep_original_cols = FALSE)

## not needed for modeling, but just to check how things are going:
prep(who_rec) %>% bake(new_data = NULL)
```

Now let's combine this feature engineering recipe together with a model. We don't have much data here, so let's stick with a straightforward OLS linear model.

```{r}
who_wf <- workflow(who_rec, linear_reg())
who_wf
```

## Extract custom quantities from resampled workflows

If you look at many of my tutorials or the documentation for tidymodels, you'll see that we can fit our workflow to our resamples with code like `fit_resamples(who_wf, folds)`. This can give us some useful results, but sometimes we want _more_. The functions like `fit_resamples()` and `tune_grid()` and friends don't keep the fitted models they train, because they are all trained for the purpose of evaluation or tuning or similar; we usually throw those models away. Sometimes we want to record something about those models beyond their performance; we can do that using a special `control_*()` function.

```{r}
ctrl_extract <- control_resamples(extract = extract_fit_engine)
```

To create `ctrl_extract`, I used the [`extract_fit_engine()`](https://workflows.tidymodels.org/reference/extract-workflow.html) function, but you have total flexibility here and can supply your own function. Check out [this tutorial](https://www.tidymodels.org/learn/models/coefficients/) for another way to supply a custom function here.

With our `ctrl_extract` ready to go, we can now fit to our resamples and keep the linear models for each resample.

```{r}
doParallel::registerDoParallel()
set.seed(234)
who_rs <- fit_resamples(who_wf, folds, control = ctrl_extract)
who_rs
```

Since we have each `lm` object for each resample, we can `tidy()` them to find the coefficients. We can do any kind of analysis we want on these bootstrapped coefficients, including making a visualization.

```{r, fig.height=4}
who_rs %>%
    select(id, .extracts) %>% 
    unnest(.extracts) %>% 
    mutate(coefs = map(.extracts, tidy)) %>%
    unnest(coefs) %>%
    filter(term != "(Intercept)") %>%
    ggplot(aes(estimate, fill = term)) +
    geom_histogram(alpha = 0.8, bins = 12, show.legend = FALSE) +
    facet_wrap(vars(term), scales = "free")
```

It looks like episodes airing on Christmas Day have **much** higher viewership, 2.5 to 3 million viewers higher than other days. Airing on New Years also looks like it is associated with more viewers, and we see evidence for a modest decrease in viewers with year.
