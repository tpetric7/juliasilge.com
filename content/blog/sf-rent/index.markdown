This is the latest in my series of [screencasts](https://www.youtube.com/juliasilge), but it is not about tidymodels this time around! I am stepping away from working on tidymodels to focus on [MLOps tools](https://vetiver.rstudio.com/) full-time, so moving forward I‚Äôll focus on a wider variety on topics in screencasts. An important part of managing deployed models is [monitoring](https://vetiver.rstudio.com/get-started/monitor.html), and this involves computing model metrics at a given aggregation. I love to use the [slider](https://davisvaughan.github.io/slider/) package by my coworker Davis Vaughan for this kind of task, and this screencast walks through how to use sliding window aggregation to analyze a recent [`#TidyTuesday` dataset](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) on rents in San Francisco. üèôÔ∏è

Here is the code I used in the video, for those who prefer reading instead of or in addition to video.

## Load data

Our analysis goal is to understand how [rents in San Francisco](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2022/2022-07-05) are changing over time. This dataset is from last month, but I didn‚Äôt get a chance to look at it then because of preparing for rstudio::conf()! Let‚Äôs filter down to apartments that are whole apartments (not a room for rent) and listings that are from the last 15 years or so.

``` r
library(tidyverse)

rent_raw <- read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/2022-07-05/rent.csv')

rent <- rent_raw %>%
    filter(room_in_apt < 1, year > 2005) %>%
    select(date, price, beds, baths) %>%
    mutate(date = lubridate::ymd(date)) %>%
    arrange(date)

rent
```

## Compute a sliding mean

Let‚Äôs [use the `sliding_period_*()` family of functions](https://davisvaughan.github.io/slider/reference/slide_period.html), since we have date information and want to aggregate in a date-aware way. These functions may reminder you of `purrr::map()` in that you can specify the *type* of the output and you pass in a function to use for the aggregation. How can we compute the mean price during each month?

``` r
library(slider)
slide_period_dbl(rent, rent$date, "month", ~ mean(.$price))
```

Nice! But I think I would like this in a dataframe, with the date that belongs to each mean price and maybe also the number that was used for the aggregation. I think this is easiest if I write a little function:

``` r
mean_rent <- function(df) {
    summarize(df, date = min(date), rent = mean(price), n = n())
}

slide_period_dfr(rent, rent$date, "month", mean_rent)
```

    ## # A tibble: 117 √ó 3
    ##    date        rent     n
    ##    <date>     <dbl> <int>
    ##  1 2006-01-01 1702.  1323
    ##  2 2006-02-03 1764.  3125
    ##  3 2006-03-01 1680.  1315
    ##  4 2006-04-01 1780.  4996
    ##  5 2006-05-01 1741.  1391
    ##  6 2006-06-02 1792.  1816
    ##  7 2006-07-05 1938.  2711
    ##  8 2006-08-11 1917.  2189
    ##  9 2006-09-01 2158.   474
    ## 10 2006-10-18 1981.   185
    ## # ‚Ä¶ with 107 more rows
    ## # ‚Ñπ Use `print(n = ...)` to see more rows

I could save this object, or I can just pipe it straight to ggplot2:

``` r
slide_period_dfr(rent, rent$date, "month", mean_rent) %>%
    ggplot(aes(date, rent)) +
    geom_line(size = 1.5, alpha = 0.8)
```

<img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="1260" />

Now the real helpfulness of slider comes in when I want to more flexibly aggregate, with a more complex sliding window. Let‚Äôs use `.before = 1`, which makes a sliding window that includes both the current month and the *previous* month:

``` r
slide_period_dfr(rent, rent$date, "month", mean_rent, .before = 1) %>%
    ggplot(aes(date, rent)) +
    geom_line(size = 1.5, alpha = 0.8)
```

<img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="1260" />

The main difference we see here is that the variation is smoothing out a bit, since we are taking the average over a longer time period.

## Different sliding windows

What does it look like if we try different values for `.before`, from one previous month to six previous months?

``` r
tibble(.before = 1:6) %>%
    mutate(mean_rent = map(
        .before, 
        ~ slide_period_dfr(rent, rent$date, "month", mean_rent, .before = .x)
    )) %>%
    unnest(mean_rent) %>%
    ggplot(aes(date, rent, color = .before, group = .before)) +
    geom_line(alpha = 0.6, size = 1.5) +
    scale_color_viridis_c() +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar) +
    labs(x = NULL, color = "How many months\nin sliding window?")
```

<img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="1260" />

We see smoother change as we aggregate with larger windows, just like we would expect!
